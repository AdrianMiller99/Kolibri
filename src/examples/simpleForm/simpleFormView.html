        <h2>Simple Kolibri Forms</h2>
        <p> Kolibri can create model-view-controller (MVC) forms by using the projector pattern.
        </p>
        <p> It only takes a single line of code to create the form,
            set up the presentation models, and bind all required listeners such that
            model and view are always kept in sync. After that, any controller can solely
            work on the presentation models and never touch the view directly.
        </p>
        <p> Only starter.js is application-specific. It sets up the information of
            what the form should consist of.
        </p>
        <p> Our initial, simplistic form does not contain any business logic and can therefore use the
            generic SimpleFormController. If we had any business logic, we would put it in a specialized
            controller and write test cases against that controller. Since we currently have no business
            logic, we have no specialized controller and no test cases for the logic.
        </p>
        <p> Models, view, and bindings are totally generic. The current simpleFormProjector only covers
            "simple" input types as available through the HTML Input element (no selects or multiple values).
        </p>
        <p> Note that we still have to test the general setup and we do so in simpleFormViewTest.js.
            It also serves as an example of how to do integration testing.
        </p>
